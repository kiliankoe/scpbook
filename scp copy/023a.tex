It's my fault. I have doomed my research team, and possibly the rest of the facility. All that's left is to keep trying. We must contain SCP-023.

\textbf{Note:} On \censor{XX}/\censor{XX}/\censor{XXXX}, one year after Incident 023-27, \censor{XX} personnel were interred in an unmarked mass grave outside Site \censor{XX}.
